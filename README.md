INSTIGATION is a match-three puzzle game and Space Invaders fan fiction. Find out why they invaded Earth!

CONTROLS:
- Left and right arrows: move left or right
- Z: shift the blocks in your column up by 1 (or hold the down arrow and press Z to shift down)
- X: lift the block you're standing on, press again to set it down

OBJECTIVE:
Match the trash blocks sent by the humans to stay alive as long as possible. Falling blocks will stun you if you're hit. A horizontal bar of blocks will fall every 10 seconds, so watch out! If any blocks are sitting above the dotted line it's Game Over.

Good luck and thanks for playing!
